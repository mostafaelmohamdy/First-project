<p>Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong</p>
<p>
  <br>
  Weak artificial intelligence is an approach to artificial intelligence research and development with the consideration that AI is and will always be a simulation of human cognitive function, and that computers can only appear to think but are not actually conscious in any sense of the word. Weak AI simply acts upon and is bound by the rules imposed on it and it could not go beyond those rules. A good example of weak AI are characters in a computer game that act believably within the context of their game character, but are unable to do anything beyond that.

Weak artificial intelligence is also known as narrow artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>
  <br>
  Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.</p>
